[Try the final build here](https://5ahmnm1920mtin-3h.github.io/home-WebGL-movingBall-lmartinusic/)

### Project description: 
This simple project consists of a screen-independent canvas (960x600), a button (Move Ball), a text (title with developer name), a script (moving the ball with the button), and a GameObjects ball (sprite2d imported)

When pressing the button "Move Ball" the ball moves randomly to a new position. 4 Positions are available (4 empty GameObjects: PosBottomLeft, PosBottomRight, PosTopLeft, PosTopRight). There are 2 different variations for moving the ball to the positions randomly.

Variation 1: direct repetition of the randomly chosen position is possible.
Variation 2: the randomly chosen position is forced to be different, i.e. new position != old position
